This repository provides a professional simulation framework for urban socioeconomic monitoring from a **Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS)** perspective. It replicates and validates the methodology proposed in the research article: *"LLM-Augmented Sensor Fusion for Urban Socioeconomic Monitoring: A Cyber-Physical-Social Systems Perspective"*.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Large-Scale ABM**: Vectorized simulation of 100,000 heterogeneous agents (households) with cross-dimension socioeconomic spillovers and coupling dynamics.
- **LLM Semantic Sensing**: Implementation of Large Language Models as semantic sensors using state-dependent noise models (Ref: Algorithm 2 in the paper).
- **Constrained EKF**: Advanced sensor fusion using Extended Kalman Filters with an **ADMM-based optimization layer** to enforce:
  - ⚖️ **Group Fairness**: Bounding deprivation disparity across protected age groups.
  - 🔒 **Differential Privacy**: Calibrated Gaussian noise injection for privacy-preserving estimation.
  - 📊 **Minimum Representation**: Correcting sampling bias in digitally excluded urban areas.
- **Observability Analysis**: Numerical computation of finite-horizon Observability Gramians to identify the "Digital Exclusion Threshold" ($d_6^{crit}$).

🔍 Implementation of Algorithm 2 (Surrogate Model)

As described in Section 6.3 of the paper, processing 100,000 agents via live LLM APIs is computationally prohibitive. Therefore, this repository implements the surrogate model version of Algorithm 2:

*   File: `core/sensors.py` -> `observe_llm()`
*   Logic: It simulates semantic sensing by sampling from the state-dependent distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{S}_g, \mathbf{R}_{LLM}(d_6))$, where:
    $$\mathbf{R}_{LLM}(d_6) = \mathbf{R}_{base} \cdot \exp(\kappa d_6)$$
*   Calibration: The surrogate is calibrated to match the error bounds observed in frontier models like GPT-4, as detailed in the methodology section.

📊 Experimental Results
The simulation framework validates several key insights from the paper:
Detection Lag: LLM-augmented fusion reduces crisis detection lags by 80-90% compared to quarterly administrative baselines.
Observability Limit: Numerically confirms the existence of a critical exclusion threshold (d6≈0.78) where the system becomes effectively unobservable.
Normative Balancing: Demonstrates that fairness and privacy constraints can be satisfied with only a marginal increase in estimation error.

📜 Academic Note: 
All experimental data and figures generated by this repository are based on numerical simulations and synthetic agent populations as described in the methodology section of the published paper.
