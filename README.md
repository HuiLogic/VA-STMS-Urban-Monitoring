This repository provides a professional simulation framework for urban socioeconomic monitoring from a **Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS)** perspective. It replicates and validates the methodology proposed in the research article: *"LLM-Augmented Sensor Fusion for Urban Socioeconomic Monitoring: A Cyber-Physical-Social Systems Perspective"*.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Large-Scale ABM**: Vectorized simulation of 100,000 heterogeneous agents (households) with cross-dimension socioeconomic spillovers and coupling dynamics.
- **LLM Semantic Sensing**: Implementation of Large Language Models as semantic sensors using state-dependent noise models (Ref: Algorithm 2 in the paper).
- **Constrained EKF**: Advanced sensor fusion using Extended Kalman Filters with an **ADMM-based optimization layer** to enforce:
  - ⚖️ **Group Fairness**: Bounding deprivation disparity across protected age groups.
  - 🔒 **Differential Privacy**: Calibrated Gaussian noise injection for privacy-preserving estimation.
  - 📊 **Minimum Representation**: Correcting sampling bias in digitally excluded urban areas.
- **Observability Analysis**: Numerical computation of finite-horizon Observability Gramians to identify the "Digital Exclusion Threshold" ($d_6^{crit}$).

Running Simulations
To execute the full suite of experiments and generate the figures/tables reported in the paper:
  ```bash
python experiments/run_all.py
  ```

📊 Experimental Results
The simulation framework validates several key insights from the paper:
Detection Lag: LLM-augmented fusion reduces crisis detection lags by 80-90% compared to quarterly administrative baselines.
Observability Limit: Numerically confirms the existence of a critical exclusion threshold (d6≈0.78) where the system becomes effectively unobservable.
Normative Balancing: Demonstrates that fairness and privacy constraints can be satisfied with only a marginal increase in estimation error.
